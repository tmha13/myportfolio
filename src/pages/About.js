          <ul>
            <li>An international student from Vietnam. I graduated from University of Arizona at the end of 2021 with a BS degree</li>
            <li>I'm confident writing codes in Java, Javascript and C++. I have experiences with Nodejs, Expressjs, SQL, Mongoose for MongoDB, and React. 
              I'm currently focusing on React to polish my front-end skill.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a minimalist, and I believe this portfolio of mine does a good job showing that.</li>
            <li>Outside of coding, I take great interest in card games, whether it be playing with cards or collecting them!
              I used to spend a lot of time on TCGs like YGO or Pokemon. Nowadays, I work on my own card game along with my group of friends.
              You can find out more about that project on my projects page!</li>
